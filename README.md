# OCT-classification
Diabetic Macular Edema is the major cause of vision-loss in highly prevalent Type 2 diabetes. OCT imaging is widely used method that can help in early its identification and prevent vision loss. Analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time.

We developed a CNN based deep neural model with 98% accuracy to classify these images into following 4 types: 

. DME (occurs when excess fluid starts to build up in the macula of the eye)

. Drusen (yellow deposits under the retina)

. CNV (Choroidal neovascularization is the growth of abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina)

. Normal
